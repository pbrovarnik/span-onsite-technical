The original in office attempt can be found [HERE!](https://github.com/pbrovarnik/span-onsite-technical/blob/main/src/onsite-attempt.tsx)

The optimized attempt can be found [HERE!](https://github.com/pbrovarnik/span-onsite-technical/blob/main/src/optimized-attempt.tsx)

Feeling a bit uneasy about not fully finishing the challenge during the given time, I revisited the original code once I got home and calmed my nerves. I discovered some inefficiencies that I had missed earlier, quickly optimized them, and completed the coding challenge efficiently. Also added some animations for a bit of flair.
